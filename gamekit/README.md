Momo
====

Momo (Make Omnimodal and Multi-OS) is the lowest layer of our
framework, designed to abstract platform differences and provide
common interfaces for the upper layer code. The Momo library includes
a few functional components covering file operations, storage, image
manipulation, font rendering, audio processing, graphics rendering,
sound mixing, input handling, and system features. The codebase is
modularized to support multiple platforms: Linux, Windows, macOS, iOS,
Android, and Web browsers.
