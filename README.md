Horizon
=======

`Horizon` is a scripting infrastructure for multimedia arts including games.

## Linguine

* Works made with `Horizon` are written in `Linguine`, our project's scripting language.
* Linguine focuses on easiness because of our belief; talents to make fun games are different than one to write complex code.
* For development, Linguine runs on interpreter and JIT compiler.
* For production, Linguine runs natively after compiled into a native binary.
* Linguine is interoperable with C; they may be mixed.

## GameKits

* Horizon has some genre-oriented game building blocks called `GameKits`.
* Our plan includes:
    * BaseKit ... 3D, audio, input and storage API
    * ActionKit ... Library for action games
    * 2DRPGKit ... Library for 2D RPG
    * 3DRPGKit ... Library for 3D RPG
