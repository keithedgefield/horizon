Horizon Project
===============

`Horizon Project` offers a suite of libraries for gaming
applications. Using these libraries, developers can create polished
games quickly with exceptional portability. Programs built with
Horizon's libraries run seamlessly across multiple operating systems
and devices - including Linux, Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, and Web
browsers. Our goal is to create a lightweight yet powerful framework
that both beginners and experienced developers can easily use.

## Linguine: A Fast, Compact Scripting Language

`Linguine` is our purpose-built scripting language designed
specifically for the Horizon framework environment. Linguine strikes
an ideal balance between simplicity and power - it's accessible for
beginners with an intuitive syntax and straightforward learning curve,
yet provides powerful capabilities and advanced features for
experienced developers who need more complex functionality.

## Momo: A Modern, Ultra-Portable Gaming API

`Momo` is the foundation framework of Horizon Project, provides a
modern, efficient API that abstracts away platform-specific details
while maintaining excellent performance. The architecture follows a
component-based design, enabling modularity and portability.

## SpriteKit: A 3D Game Library

Horizon provides `SpriteKit` - a comprehensive toolkit designed
specifically for 2D game development. This versatile component offers
a rich set of features and optimized rendering capabilities that
streamline the game creation process.

## WorldKit: A Scene-Based 3D Framework

WorldKit is an experimental attempt to make a scene-based 3D framework
on Momo.

## NovelKit: A Visual Novel Framework

NovelKit is an experimental attempt to make a visual novel engine on
SpriteKit and WorldKit.
